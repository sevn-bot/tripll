# Resumable CI gate. Runs the ordered `make ci-steps`, checkpointing each pass to
# .ci-progress, and STOPS at the first failing step (non-zero exit). On the next run it
# skips every already-passed step and resumes from the failed one — so an agent can fix
# one error and continue without re-running steps that already passed.
#
# When every step passes, the checkpoint is cleared. This is the standard pre-merge gate
# (GitHub Actions and local); use `make ci-affected` mid-wave for path-scoped checks.
#
# NOTE (by design): after a fix, earlier steps are assumed still-passing and are NOT re-run.
# If a fix might break an earlier step, run `make ci-reset` (or this script with --reset) to
# start over, or run `make ci-reset && make ci-resume` for a clean full gate.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/ci_resume.sh           # run/resume the gate
#   scripts/ci_resume.sh --reset   # clear the checkpoint and start over
#   scripts/ci_resume.sh --status  # show progress and exit
#
# Env:
#   TRIPLL_CI_PROGRESS_FILE  checkpoint path (default: <repo>/.ci-progress)
